It was originally based on the platform of the second generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car. The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first production Mustang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 inches shorter.[2] Introduced early on April 17, 1964,[3] and thus dubbed as a "1964½" by Mustang fans, the 1965 Mustang was the automaker's most successful launch since the Model A.[4] The Mustang has undergone several transformations to its current sixth generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Starry Night</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Starry Night is an oil on canvas by the Dutch post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.

&lt;p&gt;It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. It is regarded as among Van Gogh's finest works and is one of the most recognized paintings in the history of Western culture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Mona Lisa</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait of a woman by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been acclaimed as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world".&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/mona-lisa/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">c5113f08-8478-40c6-8e60-2cd462fcd0b3</guid><category>art</category><category>oils</category><dc:creator>Robert Washbourne</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2016 22:53:35 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2017/03/23b6e60923909f6b68f69ae0e2b8d12f.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2017/03/23b6e60923909f6b68f69ae0e2b8d12f.jpg" alt="Mona Lisa"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait of a woman by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been acclaimed as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world".&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Ocean</title><description>&lt;p&gt;As it is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, the world ocean is integral to all known life, forms part of the carbon cycle, and influences climate and weather patterns.
